"""Check the deepagents-code SDK pin against the workspace SDK version.

`libs/code/pyproject.toml` pins an exact `deepagents==X.Y.Z`. This compares
that pin to the version declared in `libs/deepagents/pyproject.toml` and
reports drift so it surfaces locally instead of only at release time.

Advisory by design: the hard gate is the release workflow's pin-verification
step (the "Verify package pins latest SDK version" step in `release.yml`,
which fails the publish job on mismatch). The `check_sdk_pin.yml` workflow is
a complementary advisory check that only comments on release PRs — it does
not block merge. During normal development the editable workspace source
means you always run against the local SDK regardless of the pin, so a
mismatch mid-feature is expected until you bump the pin.

Exit codes when run as a script: 0 = pin in sync, 1 = drift (advisory —
callers may treat as non-fatal), 2 = could not determine (malformed or
missing pin/version). Callers must not treat exit 2 as a pass.
